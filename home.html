        <h1>About the Currency Converter</h1>
        <p>The foreign exchange market (forex, FX (pronounced "fix"), or currency market) is a global decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC) market for the trading of currencies. 
        This market determines foreign exchange rates for every currency.
        It includes all aspects of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. In terms of trading volume, it is by far the largest market in the world, followed by the credit market.[1]
         The main participants in this market are the larger international banks. 
         Financial centers around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. 
         Since currencies are always traded in pairs, the foreign exchange market does not set a currency's absolute value but rather determines its relative value by setting the market price of one currency if paid for with another. 
         Ex: 1 USD is worth X CAD, or CHF, or JPY, etc.</p>
